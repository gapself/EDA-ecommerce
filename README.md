## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be found in the `data` directory. It includes information about customer orders, such as order ID, customer ID, order date, product details, order quantity, and order value. The dataset is available in CSV format as `data.csv`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (`data.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This README file providing project details and instructions.

## Project Details

The project includes the following steps and analyses:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Basic statistics and data summary.
   - Handling missing values.
   - Visualizing data distribution and relationships.

2. **Time Analysis:**
   - Analyzing order trends over time (e.g., monthly or weekly).
   - Identifying seasonal trends in order volume.

3. **Customer Analysis:**
   - Determining the number of unique customers.
   - Calculating the average order value per customer.
   - Identifying top customers with the highest order values.

4. **Product Analysis:**
   - Finding popular products based on the number of orders or total sales.
   - Visualizing product popularity using bar charts or word clouds.

5. **Correlations:**
   - Exploring correlations between variables (e.g., order value and order quantity) using scatter plots or correlation matrices.

6. **Data Visualization:**
   - Creating informative data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

7. **Insights and Conclusions:**
   - Summarizing key insights and conclusions from the analysis.
   - Providing recommendations for the e-commerce business based on findings.

## Usage
